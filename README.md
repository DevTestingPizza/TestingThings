# Testing Things

This is a lot of testing code, for all sorts of things. Including front-end menus in GTA V / FiveM, scaleforms and more.
Code contains comments. I will not be maintaining this or present this in any 'usable' way. This is strictly for developers to hopefully learn some things that I've been researching.


**I will not be finishing this code. So do with it whatever you want. It's a mess and contains a lot of unfinished things, but hopefully it can be useful to someone that wants to create something awesome.**
